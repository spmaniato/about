# About Spyros

## What I do

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer (Vehicle Controls)
at [Cruise Automation](https://getcruise.com) (aka GM Cruise).

For more information, please check out
[my résumé](https://spmaniato.keybase.pub/docs/Spyros_resume.pdf).

## Pull Request & Code Review manifesto

### As PR author I will

* Keep my pull requests (PRs) small but self-contained
* Write meaningful commit messages, PR titles, and PR descriptions
* Include ticket number in PR title and link to the ticket in PR description
* Include links to any additional documentation in the PR description (e.g. design doc)
* Ensure that diff / patch coverage is close to 100% and that overall project coverage doesn’t decrease
* Use a `multipart` (or equivalent) GitHub label to indicate a PR is one of many parts
* Limit the rate at which I open new PRs to match the team’s ability to review them
* Ensure that CI (both build and automated tests) is green before requesting reviews
* Request reviews and post links to PRs on team chat when (and only when) they are ready for review

### As PR reviewer I will

* Make an effort to review as soon as I get the chance (assuming the PR is small)
* Approve the PR, as long as the state of the code base is better than before
* Prefer opening a new ticket or requiring a follow-up PR over rejecting the PR
* Favor suggestions over rejections, particularly when multipart PR indicated via label
* Review the PRs of others before opening a new PR that would exceed our WIP / PR limit
